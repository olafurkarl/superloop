## Todo List Project for Superloop

### To run backend:

Call `mvn install` in project root, then run `mvn spring-boot:run` to start the application. 
This assumes that port 8080 is open.

It is then possible to see the exposed API with Swagger at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html if desired.

### To run frontend:

From the todo-frontend directory, run `npm install` and `npm start`. This assumes that port 3000 is open.
A browser window should then open to http://localhost:3000 which shows the application.

### PS
Note that this is merely a development configuration and is not intended to reflect methods used to run production code.
